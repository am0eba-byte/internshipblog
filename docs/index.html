                    <p class="post">It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon that I entered the office
                        building. With a bundle of paperclips cinching the too-loose waistline of my
                        slacks, which I haphazardly purchased the week before, I remarked on the
                        monumentousness of the day. My supervisor, Dan, gave me a tour of the
                        building, introducing me to my new coworkers at their posts as we made our
                        rounds about the office quarters. He gave me a plate of pumpkin cookies to
                        entice my fellow Larsonians to come introduce themselves at my desk
                        throughout the day. I attended my first Arjuna team meeting in the outdoor
                        courtyard area, where my software development team introduced themselves and
                        exchanged little stories of their lives leading up to Larson. I was
                        acquainted with the equipment available to me at my new work desk, including
                        my work PC, my work email, etc. Alan, the wizard of programming code, had
                        another private meeting with Dan and I later in the day to acquaint me with
                        the details, scope, and logistics of the company quest at hand: Arjuna. As I
                        currently understand it, our software development team is tasked with
                        creating Arjuna to provide a platform on which teachers and students
                        throughout the country may access Larson textbook resources, lessons, and
                        materials through a user interface designed to tailor specifically to the
                        state the users are in, the corresponding state standard competencies that
                        are required for teachers to give to students, and keep a record of how the
                        students are progressing with the material. This involves creating multiple
                        layers of structured API which integrate State Core Competencies, Larson's
                        Learning Resources, and the relationships between them. In short: it's a
                        friggen huge adventure, and now I'm in it.</p>

                    <p class="post"> Now marks the end of my second week, and I'm already beginning
                        to feel more confident about my general existence at this fine institution.
                        My feelings of repressive shyness and uncertainty have almost entirely
                        subsided, and I'm firmly grasping the project's overall structure, goals,
                        and the things I can contribute to the software code. Alan introduced me to
                        the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and sent me on my way
                        exploring the software devs' database of choice for this project: Arango DB.
                        I've begun using Arango's tools to create a JSON schema for the
                            <i>competencies</i> dataset, which is turning out to be an adventure in
                        its own right - involving copious amounts of Googling. Alan said once this
                        first schema is written and in proper order, writing the other schemas for
                        the rest of the datasets will be a piece of cake. Except the cake will be
                        avocado flavored with javascript object notation icing on top. </p>

                    <p class="span"> Week of 10/12-10/14 - Third Week </p>
                    <p class="post"> Week three was the week of data validation reckoning, it seems.
                        On Tuesday, I Googled and JSON-schema-ed my little heart out to create some
                        well-formed code which validated the rules for each object within the
                        competencies dataset of Arjuna... for the most part. The schema did the job
                        in that it prevented incorrect data inputs for each object property, for
                        example, if an object <span class="code">"Token"</span> has a key-value pair
                        where <span class="code">{"type": "string"}</span>, any data inputs entered
                        into that object that are not a string (a number, a boolean, null, etc.)
                        would be rejected. This was all well and good for <i>object</i> data, but we
                        ran into some trouble with data that contained an <i>array</i>. For
                        example:</p>

                    <div class="code"> "Definition": { "type": "array", "items": { "language":
                        {"type": "string"}, "text": {"type": "string"} } } </div>

                    <p class="post"> A <span class="code">"Definition"</span> object contained an
                        array of two property types, <span class="code">"language"</span> and <span
                            class="code">"text"</span>. The <span class="code">"language"</span>
                        property is set to only be allowed to contain a <span class="code"
                            >"string"</span>, but in the competencies data, the language inputs
                        conform to the ISO language keywords - such as <span class="code"
                            >"en-US"</span> for American English or <span class="code"
                            >"es-US"</span> for American Spanish. Setting the data type property as
                            <span class="code">"string"</span> is not specific enough to prevent any
                        strings other than the ISO language codes Arjuna uses from occurring within
                        the <span class="code">"language"</span> property. Since JSON Schema is such
                        a new language, there hasn't been documentation or rules created to make
                        string datatypes be more specific. </p>
                    <p class="post">As I continued battle-testing my schema, I realized a major
                        issue with JSON schema's limited data validation powers: since JSON Schema's
                        syntax does not include code that can define how many times an array can
                        repeat itself within an object array, preventing extra properties from being
                        allowed to occur beyond the given items in the object arrays is impossible.
                        It successfully prevents improper property types from being validated, but
                        when I add in a new random key-value pair that I did not define within that
                        object, it validates anyways. For example, the <span class="code"
                            >"Tags"</span> object array: </p>
                    <div class="code"> "Tags": { "type": "array", "items": { "language": {"type":
                        "string"}, "text": {"type": "string"}, "public": {"type": "boolean"} } }, </div>
                    <p class="post">The object array <span class="code">"Tags"</span> can have
                        multiple sets of the three items <span class="code">"language", "text",
                            "public"</span>. JSON schema does not provide the option of defining
                        exactly how many times this repetition of items is allowed to occur, and
                        when I input random incorrect key-value items, it validated the code when it
                        should not have. Alan and I had a discussion about this, and by the end of
                        it, Alan and I agreed that JSON schema was simply not the way to go in terms
                        of data validation. For now, since there are already multiple layers of data
                        validation in place when the data is created, Alan feels comfortable going
                        without another layer of validation for now - especially since this project
                        is crunched for time.</p>
                    <p class="post">While we alas are bagging the JSON schema route, I learned a
                        whole lot about JSON and OOP in general in the process of creating this
                        schema, so I'm happy that my work has lead to new discoveries - however
                        unfruitful. I am going to document my JSON schema discoveries, and continue
                        working on the data in new ways that will hopefully be more helpful to the
                        project in the coming weeks. Sorry JSON schema, but you are not Relax-NG,
                        and therefore you stink.</p>
