                <p> Mia Borgia began working as a Software Development Intern for Larson Texts, Inc.
                    on September 28th, 2021. Mia is generally posted at her position in Intern Alley from roughly noon to 5:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Here, the continuum of her adventure is updated weekly.  </p>

                    Week of 9/28-9/30 - First Week
                </p>
                    <p class="post">It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon that I entered the office building. With a bundle of paperclips cinching the too-loose waistline of my slacks, which I haphazardly purchased the week before, I remarked on the monumentousness of the day. My supervisor, Dan, gave me a tour of the building, introducing me to my new coworkers at their posts as we made our rounds about the office quarters. He gave me a plate of pumpkin cookies to entice my fellow Larsonians to come introduce themselves at my desk throughout the day. I attended my first Arjuna team meeting in the outdoor courtyard area, where my software development team introduced themselves and exchanged little stories of their lives leading up to Larson. I was acquainted with the equipment available to me at my new work desk, including my work PC, my work email, etc. Alan, the wizard of programming code, had another private meeting with Dan and I later in the day to acquaint me with the details, scope, and logistics of the company quest at hand: Arjuna. As I currently understand it, our software development team is tasked with creating Arjuna to provide a platform on which teachers and students throughout the country may access Larson textbook resources, lessons, and materials through a user interface designed to tailor specifically to the state the users are in, the corresponding state standard competencies that are required for teachers to give to students, and keep a record of how the students are progressing with the material. This involves creating multiple layers of structured API which integrate State Core Competencies, Larson's Learning Resources, and the relationships between them. In short: it's a friggen huge adventure, and now I'm in it.</p>

                        Now marks the end of my second week, and I'm already beginning to feel more confident about my general existence at this fine institution. My feelings of repressive shyness and uncertainty have almost entirely subsided, and I'm firmly grasping the project's overall structure, goals, and the things I can contribute to the software code. Alan introduced me to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and sent me on my way exploring the software devs' database of choice for this project: Arango DB. I've begun using Arango's tools to create a JSON schema for the <i>competencies</i> dataset, which is turning out to be an adventure in its own right - involving copious amounts of Googling. Alan said once this first schema is written and in proper order, writing the other schemas for the rest of the datasets will be a piece of cake. Except the cake will be avocado flavored with javascript object notation icing on top.
