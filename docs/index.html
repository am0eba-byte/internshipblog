                    Week of 9/28-9/30 - First Week
                </p>
                    <p>It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon that I entered the office building. With a bundle of paperclips cinching the too-loose waistline of my slacks, which I haphazardly purchased the week before, I remarkred on the monumentousness of the day. My supervisor, Dan, gave me a tour of the building, introducing me to my new coworkers at their posts as we made our rounds. He gave me a plate of pumpkin cookies to entice my fellow coworkers to come introduce themselves at my desk throughout the day. I attended my first Arjuna team meeting in the outdoor courtyard area, where my software development team introduced themselves and exchanged little stories of their lives leading up to Larson. I was acquainted with the equipment available to me at my new work desk, including my work PC, my work email, etc. Alan, the wizard of programming code, had another private meeting with Dan and I later in the day to acquaint me with the details, scope, and logistics of the company quest at hand: Arjuna. As I currently understand it, our software development team is tasked with creating Arjuna to provide a platform on which teachers and students throughout the country may access Larson textbook resources, lessons, and materials through a user interface designed to tailor specifically to the state the users are in, the corresponding state standard competencies that are required for teachers to give to students, and keep a record of how the students are progressing with the material. This involves creating multiple layers of structured API which integrate State Core Competencies, Larson's Learning Resources, and the relationships between them. In short: it's a friggen huge adventure, and now I'm in it.</p>
